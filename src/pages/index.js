          <p>Iâ€™m a 32 year old Dutch User Experience Designer who aims to design experiences that work on anything that can access the internet.</p> 
          <p>I investigate behavioral patterns through user research, design flows with <a href="https://www.overflow.io/" title="Overflow" target="_blank">Overflow </a> and <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/" title="Sketch" target="_blank"> Sketch </a> and prototype ideas with <a href="https://framer.com/" title="Framer" target="_blank">Framer</a> and <a href="http://principleformac.com/" title="Principle" target="_blank"> Principle</a>. In my spare time I dabble with HTML5 and React to keep up to date with new technologies and possibilities.</p>
          <p>In the past I've worked as Interaction Designer, Product Owner and Marketing Manager. All these different roles have given me a great perspective about what it takes to design a great product. Iâ€™ve won and tasted success, but also failed and learned a lot.</p>
          <p>Chances are that if youâ€™re reading this, you are involved in the creation of a modern digital product. If we have that in common, get in touch and letâ€™s grab a coffee.</p>
